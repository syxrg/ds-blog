    "text": "Global companies vary widely in revenue and growth trajectories, raising the question of what factors drive revenue growth in the business world. In this post, I analyze the Top Companies Dataset to explore whether the number of employees and industry type influence revenue growth using a regression model and data visualization.\nThe dataset includes key characteristics of the world’s largest companies, including their revenue, revenue growth, employee count, and industry type.

the multiple regression analysis, the model explores the impact of the number of employees and industry type on revenue growth. The results indicate that neither employees nor most industry types have statistically significant effects on revenue growth, as their p-values are generally greater than 0.05. The overall model explains about 41% of the variability in revenue growth (Multiple R-squared = 0.4144), but the adjusted R-squared (0.06488) suggests that the model’s explanatory power diminishes when accounting for the number of predictors. This indicates that other factors may play a more substantial role in driving revenue growth among companies.\n\n\n\nData Visualisation\nI’ll use a bar plot to compare average revenue growth across different industries, highlighting which sectors experience the fastest growth.\n\n# Create a bar plot of average revenue growth by industry\navg_growth_by_industry &lt;- companies %&gt;%\n  group_by(Industry) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg_growth = mean(revenue_growth, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nggplot(avg_growth_by_industry, aes(x = reorder(Industry, avg_growth), y = avg_growth)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Revenue Growth by Industry\",\n    x = \"Industry\",\n    y = \"Average Revenue Growth (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the average revenue growth by industry, providing valuable insights into how different sectors perform financially. Industries such as Financial Services, Financials, and Technology demonstrate the highest average revenue growth rates, indicating strong expansion and market potential. Conversely, industries like Chemical Industry, Energy Trading, and Petroleum Industry show negative average revenue growth, highlighting potential challenges or downturns in these sectors. This visualization underscores the variability in revenue growth across industries, reflecting the influence of market trends, demand, and economic conditions on sector performance.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this analysis, we explored the factors influencing revenue growth among the world’s top companies. A regression model revealed that neither the number of employees nor most industries had a statistically significant impact on growth, suggesting other factors may play a more substantial role. However, a closer look at industries highlighted significant variability, with Financial Services and Technology leading in average revenue growth, while sectors like Chemical Industry and Petroleum Industry faced declines. These findings emphasize the complexity of revenue growth dynamics, driven by a combination of sector-specific trends and broader economic forces. Future analyses could integrate additional variables, such as regional factors or market share, to deepen insights into company performance."

    "title": "Pixar Movies: Data Analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Pixar movies are some of my favourites of all time due to the great storyline, memorable characters, and beautiful animations. In this post, I will be analyzing the Pixar Movies Dataset from Kaggle. While I’ve enjoyed every Pixar movie, I’m curious to explore whether professional audience reception, as reflected by Rotten Tomatoes critics, impacts their financial success. My hypothesis is that a higher Rotten Tomatoes score correlates with higher gross revenue, as it’s reasonable to assume that professional acclaim attracts larger audiences\n\nDataset\nThe dataset comes from Kaggle and includes information about Pixar movies, such as release dates, runtimes, directors, box office revenue, Rotten Tomatoes ratings, and IMDb scores. This analysis focuses on understanding the relationship between Rotten Tomatoes ratings and total worldwide gross sales.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nI’ll start by loading the dataset and performing an initial exploration.\n\n# Load libraries \nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n\n# Read the dataset\npixar_movies &lt;- read_csv(\"pixar_movies.csv\")\n\nI need to format the data using mutate so that it can be used properly.\n\n# Convert sales columns to numeric\npixar_movies &lt;- pixar_movies %&gt;% mutate( total_worldwide_gross_sales = parse_number(total_worldwide_gross_sales), rotten_tomatoes_rating = parse_number(rotten_tomatoes_rating) )\n\nFinally, I will do some basic calculations to get an idea of the ratings and sales of Pixar movies.\n\n# Summary statistics\nsummary_stats &lt;- pixar_movies %&gt;% \n  summarize(\n    total_movies = n(),\n    avg_rating = mean(rotten_tomatoes_rating, na.rm = TRUE),\n    avg_gross_sales = mean(total_worldwide_gross_sales, na.rm = TRUE),\n    max_gross_sales = max(total_worldwide_gross_sales, na.rm = TRUE),\n    movie_with_max_sales = movie[which.max(total_worldwide_gross_sales)],\n    rating_of_max_sales_movie = rotten_tomatoes_rating[which.max(total_worldwide_gross_sales)]\n  )\n\n# Display the summary statistics as a formatted table\nsummary_stats %&gt;%\n  kable(\n    col.names = c(\n      \"Total Movies\",\n      \"Avg. Rating (%)\",\n      \"Avg. Gross ($M)\",\n      \"Max. Gross ($M)\",\n      \"Highest-Grossing Movie\",\n      \"Rating of Highest-Grossing Movie (%)\"\n    ),\n    format = \"html\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Movies\nAvg. Rating (%)\nAvg. Gross ($M)\nMax. Gross ($M)\nHighest-Grossing Movie\nRating of Highest-Grossing Movie (%)\n\n\n\n\n28\n88.35714\n395.4396\n941.6\nFinding Nemo\n99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this, I can infer that Pixar has released 28 movies, with an average of 88.4% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and average of $395 million in worldwide gross sales. Finding Nemo stands out as the highest-grossing film, earning $942 million, which aligns with my hypothesis that higher Rotten Tomatoes scores lead to higher gross revenue, as it has a 99% approval rating.\n\n\n\nVisualisation\nNext, I’ll create a scatter plot to explore the relationship between Rotten Tomatoes ratings and worldwide gross sales. A scatter plot is ideal for this analysis because it visually represents the relationship between two numerical variables, allowing us to observe patterns, trends, and potential outliers.\nTo better understand the overall trend, I’ve added a linear regression line (in red) using the geom_smooth() function. This trend line helps to summarize the general direction of the relationship—whether it’s positive, negative, or neutral. By observing the distribution of points and the trend line, we can assess whether higher critical acclaim (Rotten Tomatoes ratings) is associated with increased financial success (worldwide gross sales).\n\n# Create the scatter plot\nggplot(pixar_movies, aes(x = rotten_tomatoes_rating, y = total_worldwide_gross_sales)) + geom_point(color = \"blue\", size = 3) + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"red\") + labs( title = \"Relationship Between Rotten Tomatoes Ratings and Worldwide Gross Sales\", x = \"Rotten Tomatoes Rating (%)\", y = \"Total Worldwide Gross Sales ($ Millions)\" ) + theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the plot reveals a slight negative correlation between Rotten Tomatoes ratings and worldwide gross sales, as suggested by the red trend line. This indicates that higher critic ratings do not necessarily result in higher revenue, and in some cases, there is even a weak negative relationship.\nThere is also significant variation in gross sales across different ratings. For instance, some movies with very high ratings (close to 100%) achieved both high and low revenue, highlighting that factors beyond critical acclaim likely play a role in financial success.\nAdditionally, an outlier, likely Finding Nemo, stands out as a top-grossing movie despite being in the high rating range, further suggesting that other factors such as marketing, audience appeal, or franchise strength contribute to a movie’s success.\nOverall, this analysis challenges my hypothesis that higher Rotten Tomatoes scores directly lead to higher gross revenue.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIt seems like while Pixar movies are critically acclaimed with consistently high Rotten Tomatoes ratings, the analysis shows no strong correlation between ratings and financial success. Factors beyond critical reception, such as audience appeal, marketing, and franchise strength, likely play a significant role in driving box office revenue. This shows the complexity of predicting a movie’s financial performance based solely on critical reviews."
